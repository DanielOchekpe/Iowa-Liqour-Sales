Analysis of Iowa Liqour Sales- DES MOINES in Perspective.

This is an exploratory data analysis project with focus on liquor sales in Iowa,
in which we uncover insights and trends overtime from the sales of liquor in the geographical area.
The notebook shows different queries from extracting data, data manipulation, 
and checking for duplicates and a lot more.
